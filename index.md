# Welcome to my page! 
Hi! Thanks for checking out my website. 
I am a Computational Linguistics student at the University of ZÃ¼rich and I am currently in my first year of studies.

This website is meant to briefly introduce me. You will also find a programming task, which I solved during my second semester.<br>

** Who am I?<br>
My name is Ishwarya Sutharsan and I am 24 years old. I enjoy drawing, attending concerts, music and playing video games.<br>
Regarding lectures from my bachelor's programme, I am interested in phonetics, which is the study of speech sounds.<br>
