# Welcome to my page!<br>
Hi! Thanks for checking out my website.<br>
I am a Computational Linguistics student at the University of ZÃ¼rich and I am currently in my first year of studies.<br><br>

This website is meant to briefly introduce me. Here, you will also find a programming task, which I solved during my second semester.<br>

## Who am I?<br>
My name is Ishwarya Sutharsan and I am 24 years old.<br>I enjoy drawing, attending concerts, music and playing video games.<br><br>
Regarding lectures from my bachelor's programme, I am interested in phonetics, which is the study of speech sounds.<br>
<br>
That's it for now - Don't forget to take care of yourself! _image_
